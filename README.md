# Symmetric-elliptic-problems
A method of solving symmetric elliptic problems in high dimensions

We implement a greedy iterative algorithm in order to ﬁnd approximate solutions to a speciﬁc class of Partial Diﬀerential Equations, in high dimensions. Instructions (in french) can be found in elliptic-problems-instructions.pdf.

We also prove the consistency of the method: a handwritten report can be found in elliptic-problems-report.pdf.

The file "elliptic-problems-optimization.py" contains an implementation of another approach of solving the PDE, based on optimization.
